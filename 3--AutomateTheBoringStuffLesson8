# automate the boring stuff with python lesson 8

# Built in functions include things like print, input, len, etc
# The Standard Library contains a bunch of other stuff that's commonly used, like math, random
# import with an import statement
import random

# and now
def getRandom():
    return random.randint(1,10) # gets a random int between 1 and 10 (inclusive)

# alternatively: 
# from random import *
# this makes all the functions directly available, allowing randint(1,10) instead of random.randint(1,10)


#import sys
#sys.exit() # terminates the program.


# third party modulse can also be installed w/ pip or similar
